## Inspiration

Introducing Pirate.io -- our twist to the classic game Agar.io! All of us loved the concept behind Agar.io, but we felt that more could be done to make it fun to play. Through this project, we sought to creatively optimize the experience of playing this game with a new theme and enhanced player controls.

## What it does

We've revamped this traditional game using a fun pirate theme. As a player, you can sail the seas, collect gold, and shoot cannon balls at other ships! We've also included health + progress bars in the player menu -- these will be updated as you get hit by cannonballs or collect gold, respectively.

## How we built it

 - For the front-end, Pirate.io was built using ThreeJs to create and display the animated 3D computer graphics.
 - For the back-end, Socket.io with Nodejs were useful for the multiplayer connection.

## Challenge we ran into

Foremost, we had never worked with ThreeJs or Socket.io before! Overall, we'd say the biggest challenge we came across was how to integrate ThreeJs with Node. Some of the other obstacles we faced were getting socket connections to work, rendering the scene, adjusting the camera, animating the ocean, collisions, and the physics of the ship's movement, among many others.
